## Introduction
Wool is a web platform which allows us to create event driven automation rules, and deploy them into a semantic motor. These rules are created using a graphical interface that makes very easy the creation of these rules. Besides, these rules use spaces: places where the events or actions are defined. These spaces can be geographic places -such a the GSI laboratory- or the evented web.

This projects is divided into several modules, and it is written in Javascript, PHP and Java. Regarding the databases, Wool uses a MySQL and a MongoDB database.

Wool uses a ontology or standardized shema for managing the evented web web, that is: [EWE](http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/ontologies/ewe/). Besides, Wool supports and extends some functionalities of [DrEWE](https://github.com/gsi-upm/DrEWE), an intelligent platform for task automation.
